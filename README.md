# AI_Poker_Assistant
An online poker assistant designed to analyze real-time gameplay and support strategy improvement on ClubGG.
- Real-time Screen Reading: Uses EasyOCR to capture gameplay data, including cards, player actions, positions, and pot size. Configuration and region setup can be found in OCR.py and the accompanying config files.
- Pixel-Based Detection: All data extraction is based on screen pixels, with configurable regions to adapt to different layouts or preferences.
- Machine Learning Integration: Currently implementing ML techniques to provide actionable insights for optimal playmaking.
This Project started for my own ambition to become a better poker player using my current gameplay on ClubGG with friends. It is not intended for malicious use, and no actual gambling is involved.
